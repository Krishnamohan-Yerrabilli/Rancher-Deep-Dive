Rancher Labs is a company that provides open source container orchestration software, with a focus on community-driven development. Its main product, Rancher, is a management platform for containerized workloads on-premises and in the cloud. Rancher is vendor-neutral and can deploy workloads on various types of hardware. Rancher Labs also has other open source products, including RancherOS, RKE, K3s, and Longhorn.

- Rancher Labs was founded in 2014 in Cupertino, California, by Sheng Liang, Shannon Williams, Darren Shepherd, and Will Chanas.
- Rancher Labs released its first product, Rancher v1.0, in March 2016.
- Initially, Rancher only supported Docker Swarm and Rancher Cattle clusters for managing containerized workloads.
- Docker Swarm was an early cluster orchestration tool that introduced concepts such as defining an application as a group of containers that can be created and destroyed at any time, and using a virtual network to make containers accessible on all nodes in a cluster.
