insurable interest" in insurance terms, it means that the person buying the insurance policy would suffer some kind
of financial loss, if the insured item or person were to be damaged, lost, or pass away.

Example of Insurable Interest

let's say if I have a small bakery vicky. To protect my business, I buy an insurance policy for my bakery equipment. In this case, I
have an insurable interest in the bakery equipment because if something happened to it (like a fire or theft), I would suffer a financial loss.

the insurance policy I buy earlier helps cover the costs of repairs or replacement, ensuring that I don't face the entire financial burden alone.

Similarly, if you buy life insurance for yourself or a family member, you have an insurable interest in the person's life because my death
would cause financial hardship for my family, such as loss of income or funeral expenses. The life insurance policy helps mitigate those financial risks

The person who buys insurable policy, want to mitigate finacital loss or would suffer some kind of finicial loss, if the insured preson damaged, lost or pass away.
