insurable interest" in insurance terms, it means that the person buying the insurance policy would suffer some kind of financial loss or hardship if the insured item or person were to be damaged, lost, or pass away.Example of Insurable Interest


let's say if I have a small bakery. To protect your business, you buy an insurance policy for your bakery equipment.
In this case, you have an insurable interest in the bakery equipment because if something happened to it (like a 
fire or theft), you would suffer a financial loss.

Your insurance policy helps cover the costs of repairs or replacement, ensuring that you don't 
face the entire financial burden alone.

Similarly, if you buy life insurance for yourself or a family member, you have an insurable interest in
the person's life because their death would cause you financial hardship, such as loss of income or funeral 
expenses. The life insurance policy helps mitigate those financial risks
